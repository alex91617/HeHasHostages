This project was created for [Ludum Dare 43](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/)

The theme was: *Sacrifices must be made*

## Project Mangement

We use ZenHub which is intergrated with GitHub issues.

## Setting up environment
We recommended setting up on a Windows system.

**Unity version:** 2018.3

Make sure you have git installed and run the command:

`git clone https://github.com/josephbmanley/LudumDare43.git`

or use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) to manage your repository.


You can then open up the project in Unity!

### Commiting and Pushing Changes

#### Create a new branch

**DO NOT DIRECTLY COMMIT TO `master` OR `develop`!**

Before you make any changes, be sure to create a new branch for your code. You can do that in the cli by running the command `git checkout -b [your new branch]`

Or go to `Branch > New Branch` on GitHub desktop.
